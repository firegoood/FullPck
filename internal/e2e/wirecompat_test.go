// Does the previous release still talk to this one?
//
// The config half of this question is already covered next door in
// upgrade_test.go: a config written by an older version is decoded and run by
// the current binary. That is the right test for "an update never rewrites a
// tunnel's config", and it says nothing at all about the wire.
//
// The wire is where the risk actually is, and the codebase is full of careful
// handling that nothing verifies. The layer-3 handshake treats an empty payload
// as a peer built before that field existed. The mux version is settled on the
// control channel rather than pinned, with a paragraph explaining that raising
// it would otherwise break every mux tunnel the moment one end was upgraded.
// Every one of those accommodations is an assertion in a comment.
//
// It matters more than usual here because of how an update lands: the two ends
// of a tunnel are two machines, and they are never updated at the same instant.
// There is always a window — minutes if the operator is attentive, weeks if
// they are not — in which one end is new and the other is not. A wire change
// that forgets this does not degrade; it takes the tunnel down until somebody
// notices and updates the other side, over a link that may be the only way to
// reach it.
//
// So: both ends built from real binaries, one of them the previous release, in
// both directions.
//
// Skipped unless FULLPACK_PREV_BINARY points at a build of the previous
// release. The CI job that sets it builds that from the last tag; there is
// nothing to check out or fetch here, so an ordinary `go test ./...` on a
// laptop skips this rather than failing on a missing artefact.
