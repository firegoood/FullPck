// What a tunnel's configuration used to be, and when it stopped being that.
//
// applySpec already protects against the change that will not start: it writes
// the new config, restarts, waits, and puts the old file back if the tunnel does
// not come up. That covers the loud failure and nothing else.
//
// The quiet one has no cover at all. A configuration that starts perfectly well
// and is simply worse — a preset that suits the link less, a segment cap that is
// too small, a pool that is too large for the memory on the box — leaves nothing
// to go back to. Half an hour later, after three more changes, "what was it
// before I started?" has no answer anywhere on the machine.
//
// So every accepted change files the configuration it replaced. That is one
// store serving two purposes, which is why they are not two stores: the copies
// are what an operator restores from, and the timestamps are what the panel
// draws on the traffic chart, so "did that change help?" stops being a matter of
// impression and becomes a line on a graph.
