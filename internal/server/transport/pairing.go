// pairingTimeout is how long an accepted client connection waits for a tunnel
// connection to carry it before it is given up on.
//
// Three seconds, which is what every transport has always used, written once
// here because it was written seven times as a bare 3000 and the number was not
// the part that differed.
//
// What differed was when it was consulted. The check sat at the top of the
// pairing loop and the loop then blocked on the tunnel channel, so it only ever
// ran when a tunnel connection arrived — which means it did not run in the one
// case it exists for. A pool that has run dry delivers nothing, and the client
// connection was held open with nobody waiting on it and nothing to time it
// out: the browser sat there until it gave up on its own, the slot it took
// against max_connections was never returned, and the socket stayed open for
// the life of the run. The timeout now runs on a timer, so it fires whether or
// not anything arrives.
const pairingTimeout = 3 * time.Second

// pairingWait returns how long is left of a connection's pairing timeout.
//
// Never zero or negative: a timer built from a non-positive duration fires
// immediately and forever, which turns a pairing loop into a spin. The caller
// has already taken the expired path by then; this is the floor that makes the
// timer safe if it has not.

// requeueLocal puts a connection back on the local queue for another attempt,

//
// The send must not block, and it was a bare `g.localChannel <- incomingConn`.
// That send is made from inside the goroutine that drains this very channel: in
// the mux transports there is one such goroutine per session, and the session
// making the send is one that has just failed, so it is frequently the only one
// running. A full channel is then a goroutine waiting for itself — the queue
// holds channel_size connections while the loop that empties it is parked on a
// send into it, and the tunnel stops for good with every socket still open and
// nothing in the log to say why.
//
// A connection that cannot be re-queued is closed and its slot returned, which
// is exactly what the accept path already does when it finds the same channel
// full. Dropping one client is the cost; the alternative is dropping all of
// them until somebody restarts the service.

// a queued connection's slot used to be lost for the life of the process — a
// tunnel with max_connections that lost its control channel under load a few
// times ended up refusing everyone. The sweep repeats for a short while after
