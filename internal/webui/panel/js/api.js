 *
 * There is one code path and it is the real one. The panel used to carry a
 * second — a directory of fixtures, chosen by a flag — which was how the screens
 * were drawn before the server existed. It outlived its purpose twice over: the
 * fixtures were never shipped inside the binary, so forcing that mode on a real
 * panel fetched files that are not there and drew an empty server over a busy
 * one; and having somewhere for made-up numbers to come from is what let so
 * many of them survive on screens that were supposed to have been wired up.

 *
 * The whole panel lives under one unguessable path segment, so every address
 * it asks for has to carry it. It is read from the document rather than
 * assumed, because the server is what decides it — and it is applied here,
 * once, because this is the only file that talks to the server. A view that
